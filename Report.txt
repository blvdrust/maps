Hello, I'd like to report this server. They're violating community servers rules, and using a bunch of plugins not allowed at community tab.

Server name: [BR/LATAM] SÃO PAULO 2.0 VANILLA X2 MAX 5 WP 19/03
Category: Community
Address: 35.247.216.9:28015

https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/rust/14640884

List of plugins that they are using:

UIPlus
MagicLoot
SpawnMini
Backpacks
GatherManager
Skinbox
FurnaceSplitter
QuickSmelt
RecyclerSpeed
MagicMessagePanel
AutoBroadcast
FreeRT
SignArtists
BlueprintManager
LoadingMessages
and more..

It's not fair to keep their server running at community tab. And also they were banned from community already and openned again changing IP.
